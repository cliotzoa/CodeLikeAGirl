    <p><b>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the 
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </b></p>

    HTML is cool
    CSS is cooler
    JS is the best


        <h2><i> What do you need to create a website? </i></h2>

    Not much!
    A computer (always a good start)
    A text editor (I am using atom)
    A web browser (I am using chrome)
    Some HTML, CSS and JS files

    Follow my progress on github
